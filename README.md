# Data_Wrangling_Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the first project of the ALX-Tâ€™s Data Analyst program in association with Udacity. The goal of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations

Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. The wrangling efforts have been documented in a Jupyter Notebook `wrangle_act.opynb`, The notebook also showcases the analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
